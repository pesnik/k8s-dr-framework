# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the architecture of the k8s-dr-framework.

## Components

### Core Components
- **dr-core Helm Chart**: Main orchestration component
- **Custom Docker Images**: Specialized backup containers
- **Storage Layer**: Multi-cloud storage abstraction
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager

### Data Flow
1. CronJobs trigger backup operations
2. Backup pods execute database/config/PVC backups
3. Data is encrypted and uploaded to storage
4. Metrics are exported to Prometheus
5. Alerts are sent via configured channels

## Security Architecture
- RBAC isolation in backup-ops namespace
- Network policies for pod communication
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secret management for credentials

## Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling of backup jobs
- Multi-cloud storage distribution
- Resource limits and quotas
- Monitoring and alerting thresholds
